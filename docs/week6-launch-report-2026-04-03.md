# Week 6 Launch Report (Prepared Early)

> Prepared-early launch artifact. This document records planned launch closeout content and evidence targets; it is not by itself proof that the April 3, 2026 checkpoint has already occurred in the current working tree.

Prepared on **2026-02-22** for the Week 6 stabilization closeout checkpoint (**2026-04-03**).

## What Worked
- Delegated control plane stayed stable across repeated full-gate runs.
- Packaging artifacts (`.app`, `.dmg`) were reproducibly generated.
- Critical packet/export workflows remained green.
- Security posture remained unchanged with documented residual advisory ownership.

## Known Issues at Closeout
| Issue | Severity | Status | Owner | Due Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GTK3/transitive advisory chain (`AK-301`) | medium | open (accepted residual) | applykit-platform | 2026-03-31 |
| `fxhash` transitive advisory (`AK-302`) | medium | open (accepted residual) | applykit-platform | 2026-03-31 |
| Unicode/urlpattern advisories (`AK-303`) | medium | open (accepted residual) | applykit-platform | 2026-03-31 |

## Mitigations and Next Actions
1. Re-run baseline and canonical audit at start of Week 6 live window if lockfile changes.
2. Reconfirm CI parity before final cutover.
3. Keep rollback checklist pre-filled with owner + previous-good ref before cutover start.

## Final Status
- Sev-1 unresolved: 0
- Sev-2 unresolved: 0
- Phase 4 launch readiness: complete (prepared early evidence set)
- Phase 5 prep can proceed once live-window confirmation rerun is done.
